     *
     * What a copy would guard against is a caller that writes, not the state writing to itself.

     * any of these.
     *
     * So a reader that writes nothing has nothing to be protected from, and the copies these
     * replace cost an h = 10 SHA-256 XMSS key 896 of the 5664 bytes it allocated per getEncoded(),

     * XMSSEngine goes into a signature that outlives the call, where these are read and dropped
     * inside writeBDS. The other four had no caller left but the tests and are gone; anything that
     * needs one of them to hold still wants the copy the constructors make rather than one of its
     * own, because the depth is not obvious - cloneRetain() reaches the queues
     * nextAuthenticationPath() calls remove(0) on, and cloneTreeHashInstances() each instance it
