/**
 * Crypto functions for XMSS: the keyed hash functions F, H, H_msg and PRF of RFC 8391 sec. 4.1.2.
 * <p>
 * Each of them hashes <code>toByte(i, n) || key || in</code> under its own domain separator i, and
 * that concatenation carries no length prefix - so it is unambiguous only because every argument has
 * the fixed length RFC 8391 sec. 4.1.2 gives it: F an n-byte key and an n-byte string, H an n-byte
 * key and a 2n-byte string, H_msg a 3n-byte key and a message of any length, PRF an n-byte key and a
 * 32-byte index, where n is the digestSize this instance was built with.
 * <p>
 * Those lengths are guaranteed by the call sites rather than checked here. This class is
 * package-private and built in exactly one place - {@link WOTSPlus}, with n taken from the owning
 * key's parameters - so the set of callers is closed: every key argument is a return value of one of
 * these functions, a {@code new byte[n]} field of WOTSPlus, or key material one of the key parameter
 * classes has already pinned to n; every in is freshly allocated at the size wanted; every PRF
 * address is an {@link XMSSAddress#toByteArray()} or a toBytesBigEndian(x, 32), both always 32
 * bytes. A new call site has to keep that true: a wrong length is not rejected here, it silently
 * hashes to something else.
 * <p>
 * F and PRF each also come in a form that writes into an array the caller owns rather than
 * allocating one, for the chain walk of {@link WOTSPlus} - an h=10 key generation takes a million
 * chain steps, and each of them produces three n-byte results it reads once and drops. Those forms
 * write digestSize bytes from offset 0 and take it, in the same way as everything above, that the
 * buffer they are given holds at least that many; a shorter one fails inside the digest's own
 * doFinal rather than here, which is at least loud. They are not a second implementation of
 * anything: the allocating form is now that one into an array it has just made, so what gets hashed
 * cannot depend on which of the two a call site picked.
 * <p>
 * coreDigest also takes it that digestSize is at most the underlying digest's own output size, which
 * likewise nothing checks - the admissible (digest, n) pairs are fixed by {@link WOTSPlusOid}, and
 * one breaking that would leave the tail of the result zero rather than throw. The same bound is
 * what keeps digestSize inside the toByte table below, whose width is the largest n that fixes;
 * one above it fails there instead, on the offset, which is at least loud.
