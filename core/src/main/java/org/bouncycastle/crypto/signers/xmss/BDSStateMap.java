 * Every read and every write of the map below is taken on this object's own monitor, and one fact
 * is behind all of them: {@code XMSSMTPrivateKeyParameters.getBDSState()} hands this object out
 * live, and a signature descends the layers installing the states it builds lazily into the map it
 * is signing with. An insertion rebalances the {@code TreeMap} underneath, so anything walking or
 * looking up outside the monitor reads a tree part way through being restructured - a
 * {@code ConcurrentModificationException} at best, and at worst a lookup that answers with a null
 * or with another layer's state. Holding the monitor for the whole of an operation, rather than
 * once per lookup, is also what makes an answer coherent rather than merely intact: the signer
 * holds this same monitor for its whole descent, so what an operation here sees is every layer
 * from before that signature or every layer from after it, never a mixture.
 * </p><p>
 * What each method does with that is on the method. None of them repeats this.
